/*
Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers.

 Notice

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
For example, given array S = [-1 2 1 -4], and target = 1. The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

int main(){
    vector<int> nums = {-1, 2, 1, -4};
    cout<<threeSumClosest(nums, 1)<<endl;
    return 0;
